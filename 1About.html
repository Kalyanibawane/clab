            </h1>

            <p><b>Cultural Significance:</b> Mehndi is deeply rooted in traditions, symbolizing joy, love, and
                prosperity, especially during weddings and festivals.</p>
            <p><b>Artistic Expression: </b>It showcases intricate designs, allowing artists to creatively express
                themselves through various styles, from traditional to modern.</p>
            <p><b>Natural and Safe:</b> Made from the henna plant, mehndi is a natural, chemical-free dye, making it
                safe for all skin types.</p>
            <p><b>Temporary Yet Meaningful:</b> Mehndi is a temporary art form that lasts one to three weeks, allowing
                for beautiful designs without permanent commitment.</p>
            <p><b>Community and Connection: </b>The application of mehndi is often a communal activity, bringing people
                together to celebrate and bond during special occasions.</p>
